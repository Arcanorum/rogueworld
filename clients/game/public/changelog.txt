An ominous veil of darkness has fell upon the world, ushering in a new age of uncertainty for the denizens of Munud City.
Strange figures have been reported swarming in the shadows at night, mauling any creature foolish enough to wander near...

Could this be related to the recent appearance of more drawfs in the known lands? Have they brought this curse with them, or 
were they fleeing from it themselves? Perhaps a journey into the western mountains will reveal the mystery of this adumbral plague...

    - Some creatures now only spawn during certain times of day.

- Fixed being able to go over the stat level cap if you joined the game with more than the level cap's worth of exp.

- Pushing effects (wind staff, hammers) can no longer push players in a safe zone.
- Key dropping creatures in dungeons now only drop 1 key.
