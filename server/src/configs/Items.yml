# name
# A unique human readable name to use for the generated Item class for this item type.
# Used in the code to get items by their name, instead of by their code.
# i.e. `ItemsList.BY_NAME["IronSword"]` will be a reference to the IronSword item class.

# code
# A unique randomly generated code to identify this item config.
# It is important that this code does not describe anything about the item itself, as it should
# just be used as an identifier for this config, so it can be stored in the database and when
# loaded back into the game when a player logs in, the right item config can be found, even if
# other values on the config have changed, such as the name.
# As such, once set, this code should never be changed, as doing so would mean that any saved items
# won't know which config to use when loaded again.
# There is a script that can be ran in a terminal to generate a standard item code for you.
# In the root of the project, run:
# `npm run itemcode`
# Which would output:
# * Generated item code:
# KSES6122 <-- a new item code to use for this config

# extends
# Optional. A path (relative from server/src/items/classes) to the class file that this item type
# should extend from.
# When an item extends from another class, it will inherit the functionality of that class.
# Some other config properties that can be set for this item type only work when the appropriate
# class is extended from.
# e.g. The defenceBonus property only works when extending clothes/Clothes.

# translationID
# A value from the ID column in the ITEMS tab in the translations spreadsheet to use to get the name and
# description for this item in language selected by the player.
# Just the item name itself, which gets added onto the "Item name: " and "Item description: "
# prefixes on the client to create the actual id.
# e.g. Where there would be "Item name: Iron sword" and "Item description: Iron sword" for an item
# in the spreadsheet, simply use "Iron sword" here and the client will figure out the rest.
# Translations spreadsheet:
# https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n6jSigPBWrubNQMTz00GsLIh3U8CMtfZH8wMFYmfHaA

# textureSource
# The base name of the texture/sprite/image/whatever to use for this item on the client.
# e.g. For an iron sword item, this value will probably be "iron-sword".
# This would make the source image to use for the GUI icon to be "icon-iron-sword", and the pickup
# sprite to be "pickup-iron-sword", so make sure that assets with those file names exist.

# pickupSpriteScaleModifier
# Optional. How much to scale the sprite of the pickup of this item from it's default size.
# e.g. pickupSpriteScaleModifier: 0.7 would scale the pickup sprite down to 70% of its base size.

# soundType
# # Optional. The name of the group of sounds to play when this item is dropped, equipped,
# unequipped, or used. See SoundManager.js in client.

# category
# # Optional. A generic way of grouping items by purpose.
# What this does specifically depends on what the item is interacting with.
# e.g. An ore rock resource node would only allow gathering when an item of the "Pickaxe" category
# is used on it, so any pickaxe type items should use that category here.
# See the ResourceNodes.yml configs for what item category is required for each resource node type.

# ProjectileType
# Optional. The class name of the projectile type to create an instance of when this item is used.
# Each weapon item that shoots out some kind of projectile should have an associated projectile entity class.
# e.g. for an IronSword item that extends holdable/weapons/Weapon, there should also be in the
# entities list a ProjIronSword entity class that extends from the Projectile class.
# The projectile classes are automatically generated from the list of configs in Projectiles.yml.
# Simply use the `name` property of any config defined there for this property.

# canUseIntoHighBlockedTile
# Optional. Whether this item can be used in the direction of a blocked tile (i.e. a wall) while
# standing adjacent to it.
# When set to false, a 1 tile gap is required to use an item in the direction of a blocked tile.
# For most items that create a projectile when used, the projectile is added on top of the blocked
# tile, and then immediately collides with it and then is destroyed, but for items that add
# projectiles in an unusual way (i.e. not added to a tile directly adjacent the player), they may
# cause projectiles to be added on the other side of a blocked tile, effectively allowing them to
# shoot over walls.

# unitWeight
# Optional. The weight value of this item, either for the whole item for an unstackable, or for
# each one in a stack of stackables.
# Can be either a number, or a string name of a item weight class in ItemWeightClasses.yml.

# baseQuantity
# Optional. For stackables, this is the default quantity to use when no specific quantity is
# specified for where this item type is used.
# e.g. This will be the size of the stack given to a player for pickups spawned by pickup spawner,
# created by a crafting recipe, or bought from a shop.

# baseDurability
# Optional. For unstackables, this is the default durability (and max durability) to use when no
# specific quantity is specified for where this item type is used.
# e.g. This will be the durability of the item given to a player for pickups spawned by a pickup
# spanwer, created by a crafting recipe, or bought from a shop.

# gatherTimeReduction
# Optional. For gathering tools, the percentage to reduce the gather time by when this item is used
# to gather from a resource node.

# defenceBonus
# Optional. How much to increase the player's defence by when this item is equipped.

# useEnergyCost
# Optional. How much energy is consumed when this item is used.

# expGivenStatName
# Optional. The name of the stat to give exp in when this item is used.

# expGivenOnUse
# Optional. How much exp to give in the selected stat (expGivenStatName) when this item is used.

# statBonuses
# Optional. A list of stat names and values for how much to increase each stat by while this item
# is equipped.
# e.g.
# statBonuses:
#   Weaponry: 2
#   Toolery: 4

# craftTasks
# Optional. A list of the names of tasks that will be progressed when this item is crafted. e.g. Craft,
