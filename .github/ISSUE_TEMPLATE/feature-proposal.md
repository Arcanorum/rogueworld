### Goals
<!-- A brief, high-level problem statement or value proposition, describing what this feature is for. Why is this feature actually important and why should it be worked on, instead of some other task? --> 

### Feature description
<!-- A clear and concise explanation of what you think should be added or changed. Describe the expected behaviour and effects of the feature. -->

### Design pillars
<!-- Which of the design pillars of the game does this feature support, and how? Features that don’t support a core design pillar in a meaningful way are considered out of scope and will likely won’t be considered. -->

### Considerations
<!-- The wider scope of the impact this feature will have. Ways in which this feature will interact with other features, and the anticipated outcomes. What existing game systems will this feature make use of? What side effects will this feature have? How will it be balanced? -->

### Success metrics
<!-- What does success look like for this feature? How would someone be able to tell if this task was worth doing, and whether it has been completed to a good standard? What is the expected outcome of the end result? -->

### References
<!-- What other games, audio, images, etc. could be used as a reference point for this feature, to better illustrate to someone reading this what the feature is about. -->

### Assets required
<!-- A list of potential assets (sprites, particles, icons, sound effects, music, text, etc.) that need to be added as part of this feature. -->
